# Cast Study: Employee Attrition
Built and evaluated models to predict employee attrition and find top predictors

The jupyter notebook includes all the code and analysis for the project. It also includes my thought-process and takeaways/conclusions.

The Tableau workbook includes the visualization. In the workbook, the final visualiztion is in a story format (the last tab called "attrition factors".)
